# Organization configuration for {{_organizationName.title}}
Infrastructure-as-code for {{_organizationName.title}}'s teams and people.

## To run
```
yarn install
yarn build
AWS_ACCESS_KEY={key} AWS_SECRET_KEY={secret} yarn synth
cd cdktf.out
terraform init
TF_WORKSPACE=prod terraform plan -out=prod.tfplan
terraform apply prod.tfplan
```

## Adding new people and teams
There are a couple yarn commands you can use to add new people.

To create a new `config` file for a person, run:

```
  yarn add-person {firstName} {lastName}
```

This will create a new src/config/people/first_last.ts file. The name of the manager should also be in the same format, i.e., manager: "first_last". The team file src/config/teams/team_name.ts *must* be added with the new team member with the pattern set in that file.

To create a new `config` file for a team, run:

```
  yarn add-team {teamName}
```

To re-generate composite `people` files for use in a `Team` config file plus composite `team` files, run:

```
  yarn regen
```

To clean re-generated files using `regen`, run:

```
  yarn regen:clean
```
